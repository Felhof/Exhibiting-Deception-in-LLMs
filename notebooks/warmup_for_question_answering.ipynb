    "Trlx does not accept a lora trained model, or at least I could not figure out how to make it load one (however, you can make it convert a pretrained model to lora after it started).\n",
    "There is also a bug when using `int8_training` where the loss does not have a gradient - this seems to only happen with the language modeling objective and not for classification, hence we did not run into this issue when training a judge.\n",
    "As a consequence, we can't use a lot of memory optimization for warming up models, at least not until we have moved on from trlx. Make sure to use `torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16` when loading the model and use a low batch size for larger models!"
